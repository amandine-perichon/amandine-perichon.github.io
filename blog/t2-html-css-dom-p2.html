        <h2>Layout, Semantic and Beards</h2>
        <p>Grids and semantic elements are great tools for web developers. Image Placeholders with beards too... kind of!</p>
        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>

        <p>Grid based design is the practice of dividing your webpage into a grid, using different arrangements of number of columns and widths. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>1 row of 100%</li>
          <li>3 columns of 33% width each</li>
          <li>2 columns of 25% width and 1 column of 50%</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>To each type of column corresponds a CSS class that can be applied to different HTML elements, and reused throughout the website.</p>

        <p>Many websites use a grid with 12 columns as this gives quite a lot of flexibility. More than 12 columns however would make for too narrow columns.</p>

        <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>

        <p>Responsive design means developing websites which will resize and adapt to different sizes of screen (different resolutions) and types of devices, ensuring the website is still legible and is looking great.</p>

        <p>With the multitude of devices out there - desktops, laptops, phones, tables of different sizes - no wonder there is a hype about responsive webpages!</p>

        <p>The chrome dev tools have a cool feature that lets you view a webpage in a different screen size.</p>

        <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>

        <p>When using semantic structure to build a webpage, one uses elements that have a defined meaning. For instance, the webpage could contain a header, section, and footer. Users will expect the top of a website to contain a header with a website name and a navbar.</p>

        <p>HTML5 includes tags called semantic elements, which give information about the type of content these elements of the website will contain: header, footer, article, aside.</p>

        <p>Previous versions of HTML achieved semantic structure through assigning a class to elements which are not specific to a type of information. For example &lt;div class="header"&gt; would containt a header, where div elements are not specific to a type of content.</p>

        <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>

        <p>It was interesting to know what adaptive design is, and that it's different from responsive design. It's also pretty cool to see in practice how to implement responsive design through Media Queries.</p>

        <p>I have used a reset in the first version of my website, by copy pasting it, but I'll try to use a link to a reset for my next version.</p>

        <p>And lastly... let's say that it was interesting to see what people have invented as image placeholders! Beards? Really? A bit disappointed though that I couldn't find one with unicorns!</p>
