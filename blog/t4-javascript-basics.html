        <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
        <p>
          Javascript allows for complex logic, including control flows and loops, whereas HTML and CSS are more descriptive languages. Javascript can be used to implement interative features on a website.
        </p>

        <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Control flow</strong> process starts with assessing a situation, then depending on this situation, taking one or more actions. 
        <p>
          An example of control flow in everyday life:
          <ul>
            <li>Assessing the situation: is the fridge empty?</li>
            <li>
              Depending on the situation, take action<br>
              <ul>
                <li><em>If</em> the fridge is full: Decide what to eat and cook dinner</li>
                <li><em>Else</em> it means the fridge is empty: Decide where to eat out, get in your car and go eat at the restaurant</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of control flow:
          <ul>
            <li>Assessing the situation: Ask your friends if they want to watch a movie, play boardgames, or go out?</li>
            <li>
              Depending on the situation, take action<br>
              <ul>
                <li>In <em>case</em> they want to watch a movie: Decide what movie to watch and put the movie on</li>
                <li>In <em>case</em> thet want to play boardgames: Decide what boardgame to play, get the boardgame out and start playing</li>
                <li>In <em>case</em> they want to go out: Decide where to go and how to dress, they go out</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After your activity, resume to the next step is your daily process: go to sleep - your allowed to take a <em>break</em></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>Loop</strong> is the process of repeating the same action until reaching a defined situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          An example of loop in every day life:
          <ul>
            <li>Action to be repeated: manually clean the wine glasses</li>
            <li>Until reaching a defined situation: all glasses are clear</li>
            <li>In this case, the number of glasses is predefined, hence we know how many times we will need to repeat the action of cleaning a glass</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Another example of loop in every day life:
          <ul>
            <li>Action to be repeated: scrub the stain of red wine glasses you've done on the carpet</li>
            <li>Until reaching a defined situation: Stain has disappeared</li>
            <li>In this case, you don't know exactly how much scrubbing is required in advance</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
        <p>
          Arrays and Objects are both used to store data or values of different types (string, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects): 
          <ul>
            <li>An array is a group of ordered values, where each value is represented by an index: a number starting at 0, and increasing by one for the next value in the array</li>
            <li>An objet is a group of key - value pairs, where a key can be any number or word</li>
          </ul>
          Accessing information contained in an array is done by referring to the position (index) of the piece of data in the array. Accessing information contained in an object is done by referring to the key representing the data.
        </p>

        <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>
        <p>
          A function is defined as a set of actions. These actions are regrouped in a high level concept, the function, and can be reused throughout your code. It limits code repetition: remember D.R.Y. A function is defined as taking a set of parameters which value will be taken into account during the execution of the actions. It can also return an output from its execusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is an everyday life example: "Making a smoothie" is your function. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Making a smoothie requires the execution of several actions: prepare the fruits, get the right quantity of milk and other ingredients ready, pour all the ingredients in the mixer, and mix. Everytime you make a smoothie, you will take the same actions, although you have some variety in the type of smoothie you can make!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make a smoothie with different ingredients, for instance: Banana, almond milk and cashew nuts. Ingredients are your function parameters, banana, almond milk and cashew nuts are the arguments used to execute the function. 
        </p>

        <p>
          ...and the output is a delicious smoothie!
