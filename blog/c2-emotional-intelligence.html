        <h2>Search Inside Youself: Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="disclaimer">
          <strong>Disclaimer</strong>
          <br>Higher EQ side effects include increased happiness, excellence at work, and better leadership skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is defined by Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer as <br><quote>The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.</quote>
        </p>

        <p>
          Although early studies have focused on IQ - Intelligence Quotient - more recent studies have shown EQ - Emotional Quotient" to be a better predictor of success at work and fullfilment in life than IQ. 
        </p>

        <p>
          EQ is not an inate ability, it can be learned, and with practice you get better at it. <em>Search Inside Youself</em> focuses on training Emotional Intelligence, rather than focusing on changing behaviours, based on the idea that positive behavioral changes will occur as Emotional Intelligence increases. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Working on improving EQ starts with training attention. In order to be able to detect your and other's emotions, one needs to pay attention to these in order to give youself the opportunity to choose the appropiate response. Mindfulness - <quote>“paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally”</quote> (Jon Kabat-Zinn) can be used to train attention as a type of meditation. 
        </p>

        <p>
          While practicing 2 minutes of mindfulness meditation, concentrating on my breathing, I found it really easy to get distracted by the things you have on your mind or noises around you. I suppose the exercise is more or less difficult depending on your level of tiredness, stress, and your surrounding environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had tried to think about "in" and "out", concentrating on those words while practicing mindfulness meditation, but after reading the first chapter of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> I tried focusing on the physical aspects of my breathing: the air entering and leaving my nostrils, my chest rising and falling, or my lungs inflating and deflating. I find this is an easier way of concentrating.
