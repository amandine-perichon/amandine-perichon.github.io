        <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>

        <p>
          I feel like the process over product concept should be a no brainer. We're here to learn, not to create the perfect website. BUT... I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm glad that I was reminded of the "process over product" concept in this case.
        </p>

        <p>
          In all honesty, I spent 3 times the number of hours I should have on this assignment, but I'm glad I did. I did not focus too much on what the website looked like, but on understanding how to implement the functionalities I had chosen. And I had a good experience doing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working on this website, I have learned a lot, played a lot, been frustrated, had hurray moments, felt great and felt discouraged at times. I gave it a go, and I was kind to myself in the process.
        </p>

        <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>

        <p>
          I've started looking into meditation since I decided to register for Dev Academy. Before that though, I thought meditation was some hippie trend that no scientific minded person would have an interest in (and I consider myself part of this category).
        </p>

        <p>
          Since I've started looking into it, I've been intrigued.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since I've started reading Search Inside Yourself, I feel glad some other scientific minded people have looked into this and wrote an accessible book about it. I feel it's ok to be intrigued - who cares if anyone thinks I'm a hippie, right?
        </p>

        <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>

        <p>
          For me, the most useful piece of information in this chapter is the guidelines on how to deal with self-criticism during meditation. The grandmother analogy does not speak to me, but I have a loving partner and can well imagine adopting his state of mind towards me.
        </p>

        <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>

        <p>
          Two pieces of technique stand out to me: being relaxed and alert at the same time, and posture.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a couple dancer, I've spent some time working on my posture. The posture technique I have learned for couple dancing is very similar to the one given in the book. Also, being relaxed but alert reminds me of the state of mind of a follower: relaxed in your body in order to be able to be lead easily, and very attentive and reactive to what your partner does.
        </p>

        <h4>Any other musings?</h4>

        <p>
          I like the view that meditation is just mental training. Who wouldn't want to do it?
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not sure yet how I feel about the claim that "Hapiness is the default state of mind".
