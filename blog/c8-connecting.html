          <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
          <p>
            I have tried being open and sincere with other people, trusting them, hoping to be trusted in return. I have tried putting myself in someone else's shoes to try to see their point of view.
          </p>
          <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
          <p>
            It is not easy to understand or express the subtlties of your own feelings. Similarly, although it comes easily to understand the overal feeling expressed by the other person, it feels difficult to understand the nuances.

          <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
          <p>
            I liked the loving kindness meditation. The instructions mention visualizing someone you care about. I did expect that, thinking about someone I care about, I would easily wish for that person to be happy. Furthermore, by wishing that person to be happy, the exercise reminded me that, when you disagree or have an argument, the other person usually does not mean ill, has another point of view, but still only wants to be happy. It reminded me to give the benefit of the doubt.

            The Operations team has decided not to manage a support issue related to one of the web products. It expects the Project team to manage the issue as the product was never handed over to Operations formally. No handover documents were supplied, and as a result the team is not familiar with all the features, does not have trouble shooting guidelines or contact details of the vendors responsible for the product. The operations team has done its bests for the last two years to support the product but believes the Project team is best placed to handle this issue, and is responsible because of the lack of handover documentation. Operations support many products and does not have the resources to build up the knowledge without the help of the Project teams.

            The project team would like the operational team to manage a support issue related to one of the company's product. It is the responsibility of the Operations team to manage support issues. The product has been deployed in production two years ago and, even though no formal handover documentation was provided to the Operations team at the time, believes that Operations has acquire the necessary knowledge over the last two years. The project team believes that the fact that the handover process was not followed by the previous project team should not get in the way of Operations taking charge of an issue that fall under its responsibility. Operations should be proactive in getting its team members the knowledge it needs to support the company products.
