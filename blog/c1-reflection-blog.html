        <h2>My first week at Dev Academy</h2>
        <p>It's only my 4th day of the remote phase, and I'm already loving it! It just feels like the right place for me.</p>

       <p>The culture at EDA is exactly what I was looking for. As an EDA teacher said: taking part in the EDA bootcamp is like being in the kitchen preparing your food together with your fellow students - rather than sitting at a table in a restaurant expecting your education to be fed to you. At EDA you create your own study environment, and contribute to the experience of your cohort members. This sounds like the kind of environment in which I will thrive. So far I've been really proactive about gaining web dev skills and I'm also trying to help my cohort on Slack when I can.</p>

      <p>Before registering for the bootcamp, I attended "A day in the life at EDA" in Wellington. This gave me a pretty good idea of what to expect about the format of the challenges and the importance given to engineering empathy during the bootcamp. The start of the bootcamp has made me even more comfortable with my choice, and it feels great to see the level of motivation in my cohort.</p>

      <P>Things I'm excited about</P>
      <ul>
        <li>CREATING stuff</li>
        <li>learning, like crazy, everyday</li>
        <li>having fun fun fun</li>
        <li>gaining in depth understanding of the subjects I'm interested in</li>
        <li>collaborating with like-minded individuals - GO NIKAU!!!</li>
        <li>being part of a community: the EDA community &amp; the dev community</li>
      </ul> 

      <p>Things I'm nervous about</p>
      <ul>
        <li>my job getting in the way of my study hours, and helping my cohort</li>
        <li>not getting enough sleep because my brain is so exited it won't shut down at night</li>
        <li>pair programming -- scared --</li>
        <li>on the long term, finding a job, an amazing one that is</li>
      </ul>
