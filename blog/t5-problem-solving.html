        <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem and solved a problem in an elegant way?</h4>
        <p>
          At some point last week, I was blocked on an assignment as was not using the bracket notation to access an object property, whereas this was needed. I read the error messages, which provided the line of the error, and that the operations I was trying to do couldn't be done on <em>Undefined</em>. Although it wasn't when I started learning programming, debugging now just feels normal, code mostly doesn't work on the fist run attempt, but it's ok, that's how you learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I read about currying in the Eloquent Javascript chapter on higher order functions, I used  the concept to refactor this week's assignments, creating 1 makeColor function instead of makeBlue, makeOrange, makeGreen. Less repetition is more elegant.
        </p>
        <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>: Pseudocoding feels useful when detailed enough that it provides good structure, but not as detailed as to make you feel like you're losing too much time.</li>
          <li><strong>Trying something</strong>: Always and forever!</li>
          <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>: My current rubber duck is 1m86, has brown hair, hazelnut eyes and is called Nic. Looking at getting myself a real rubber ducky, a pink one that makes funky noises when you press on it. Kidding aside, it's a good technique for major blockers. It feels like explaining to someone/something else activates a different part of your brain, and I usually find the missing piece of the puzzle.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong>: This is my first step when debugging, it helps figuring out the "stupid little mistakes", like typos or syntax errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Console.logging</strong>: my most often used technique. It might be more useful for me to learn how to use debugger statements?</li>
          <li><strong>Googling</strong>: This usually doesn't help me find out what the problem is, but rather how to solve it.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>: I'm sometimes very stubborn, I like to figure things out on my own. This being said, I feel like it will be quite different when we work on group projects, and we share the responsibility of the outcome. I feel like it will be easier to ask for help.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>: If I'm really not OK, believe me, you'll hear about me.</li>
          <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>: I'm convinced reflecting on your learning is worth the time and effort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Explain to your non-tech friend: Array.prototype.filter(), .map() and .reduce()</h4>
