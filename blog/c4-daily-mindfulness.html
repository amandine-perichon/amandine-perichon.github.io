          <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
          <p>
            I personally felt like it was hard to fully concentrate, without having your mind wandering from time to time, but it was easy enough to notice when your mind did wander, and easy to come back to concentrating on the conversation. Also, I felt like the exercice makes you aware of how you explain a subject and makes you realize that your thoughts are not especially well structured or easy to loop back. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My exercise partner found it easy to concentrate without having his mind wander at all. He felt that, althought it was easy to concentrate, it was more difficult to absorb and structure the thoughts in a way that could be looped back. This was partly due to the subject of the conversation being very subjective and about emotions, rather than about an objective subject.
          </p>
          <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
          <p>
            "Mindfulness Without Butt on Cushion", the name of chapter 3 of Search Inside Yourself, represents well the fact that there is more than one way to go about mindfulness meditation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like the idea of being able to integrate meditation practice in your everyday life, so my take on this question is: use different techniques, whether it's mindful walking, mindful eating, mindful listening, mindful conversation, or focusing on a joyful activity. At some point I might get a feeling of what works best for me, but it's too soon to tell.
          </p>
          <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
          <p>
            Don't laugh... I've tried mindfully putting make up on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was thinking about the example given in the book about mindful walking while going to the restroom. I asked myself, what activity do I do everyday, that only takes a few minutes, and is a task I'm so used to that it doesn't require too much concentration, a task where my mind usually wanders about. Well, putting make up on felt like a good candidate!
