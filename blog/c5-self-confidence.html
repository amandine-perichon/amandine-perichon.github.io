        <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4> 
        <p>
          Self-awareness is a type of mindfulness directed towards yourself. It is a state of clarity and attention about yourself and your emotions. As such, self-awareness is trainable.
        </p>
        <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
        <p>
          I tried a Body Scan practice. I feel it's quite easy to physically notice tension, stress or anxiety, as well as noticing the change when thinking about a positive emotion. I'm not sure about other emotions though, or about lack of emotions, those might be harder to notice.
        </p>
        <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
        <p>
          Our emotions are not who we are, we can experience them as we would other physiological phenomena. We can recognize them and act on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree with the author of the book regarding the fact that noticing your own emotions allows you to act on them. You can soothe them by engaging the thinking part of your brain, rationalizing the events which lead to those emotions, or by experiencing other happier emotions. Noticing your emotions allows you to adjust your behaviour towards yourself and others, and to not being controlled by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel it is dangerous though to suggests that we can gain "mastery over our emotions" as this can be interpreted as <em>controlling</em> our emotions. Ever tried stopping to be sad? stopping to be angry? It usually doesn't work! I believe emotional awareness, noticing our emotions and aknowledging them, allows for something more powerful than control: acceptance.
