          <h2>A reflexion on time management and habits</h2>

          <p>Here are my thoughts after reading the course content on time management and habits.</p>
      
          <p>I've been skeptical about meditation so far, but reading about the benefits associated - better focus and memory, less stress and anxiety, more compassion and creativiy - I'm willing to give it a try! I think most of us already practice (moving) meditation without realizing it: we all have that activity that helps clear our mind. For me, this would be dancing and walking, whether it's a short walk around the block, a day tramp in NZ or a hike in the Himalayan mountain. This week, I've tried breathing meditation as well and I will continue the practice next week.</p>

          <p>I enjoyed reading about the theories on resistance mindset, and growth vs fixed mindset. The first step in changing these behaviours is to be aware that they exist, and to be able to pinpoint in which areas we adopt them. I definitely have a growth mindset when in comes to coding. I believe this feeling of self-efficacy has been built through being successful at programming classes at Uni, and using programming in some work-related tasks. Areas where I tend not to have a growth mindset: writing content other than formal or technical (e.g. writing a blog) and knowing and handling hardware. I will watch out for these areas in the future!</p>

          <p>Although I understand and agree with some of the concepts of the Pomodoro method, I don't believe a defined 25 min timebox is a good fit for me. Estimating time required to complete tasks and protecting myself from interruptions and distractions are habits that I already have. However, I feel that it is better for me to define the length of the timebox depending on the task. It does not mean that I don't recognize the value of timeboxing, stopping your work to reflect on your objective and evaluating what remains to be done. And I am also aware that I won't always be able to choose the timebox length, as with the 1 week sprints during the bootcamp.</p>
          
          <p>I'm big on taking the approach "do what works best for you", which is why I related easily to the resource content about counter intuitive ways to be productive, and finding and respecting your own rythm. I strongly recommand reading Daniel H. Pink's book <em>Drive</em>, which presents a modern theory on motivation where <em>autonomy</em> plays a critical role.</p>

          <p>B.J. Fogg's talk about habits was very entertaining. I will give a go at starting with small behaviours to create a habit, and use an "after" trigger: After I complete changes in Sublime, I will learn a new shortcut (or relearn one I have forgotten). Hopefully this will turn me into a shortcut Ninja!</p>

          <p>Finally, I understand the concept of flow as this perfect balance where a task is enough of a challenge that is it not boring, but not so challenging that it becomes a source of anxiety. Reading the resources though, I feel it is still very abstract for me how to find a state of flow. It's a fantastic feeling though, so well worth putting additional time to understand how to find it.</p>
