          <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
          <p>
            Based on my personal experience of leading and following, and my own personal beliefs, I strongly believe that compassionate leadership is the most effective leadership. I've  experienced working for a manager that had no compassion whatsoever and who thought being a jerk would bring better result, and I found that to be completely untrue, the team was demotivated in pain and turnover was extremly high.

          <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>
            This felt really similar to the loving kindness meditation.
          </p>
          <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>
            Breathing in your own suffering felt beneficial compared to simply reflecting on what is going on in your life that might cause you suffering. I believe this is because there is no space for judgment, no "but" or no "did I deserve it?". Just breathe in and breathe out.
          </p>
          <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Status:</strong> Improving my technical skills during Phase 0 has definitely been rewarding. I don't believe there were any status threats. We've had limited interactions in a group, ouside of pair programming which was a positive experience for me. During the bootcamp, our interactions in a group setting might bring up some status threats.
            <strong>Certainty: </strong> I definitely felt a lot of uncertainty before registering for the bootcamp, trying to figure out what my next step in life would be.I currently do no feel any uncertainty towards the bootcamp as I believe that this is exactly were I should be and what I should be doing. This feeling is unlikely to change during the bootcamp. The big unknown though is what I will be doing after the bootcamp, and I feel that my anxiety towards this is only going to grow. 
            <strong>Autonomy:</strong> The EDA experience is helping out greatly with the efficiency of my learning but I still feel that I am in charge of my own learning. I just have a lot of help to achieve my goal. As such I feel a great sense of autonomy.
            <strong>Relatedness:</strong> I've met most of our cohort members by now and have had pleasant interactions with them. I'm hoping it will get even better, and that we'll forge a strong bond over the coming weeks. 
            <strong>Fairness:</strong> I have a lot of support from my partner, I'm very lucky, but I suppose sometimes it feels I have an unfair advantage. 
          </p>
          <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h4>
          <p>
            I've had a few tough conversations with clients and team members while working as a project manager. I've always tried to put myself in the other person's shoes and reflect on the situation from a third person point of view on a content and feeling point of view, less so on an identity level.
