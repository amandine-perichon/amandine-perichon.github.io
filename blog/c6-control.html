          <h4>When programming, what are some of my triggers? What causes a disproportionately large emotional response?</h4>
          <p>
            I really enjoyed the minesweeper assignment this week, but it did trigger some negative emotional responses on my part.
          </p>
          <p>
            When programming, I don't have any problem with my code not working right away. I'll go through all the options we have for debugging, I'll look at errors in the console, I'll console log everything, I'll talk to my rubber duck or I'll google key words. Yes, it's sometimes frustrating but I feel it's ok being frustrated. What happened this week though, is that there were two instances in which I could not find any problem with my code. I got to the conclusion that
            <ul>
               <li>my browser did not support one of the functions used in the library</li>
               <li>one of the functions in the library did not take into account one edge case</li>
             </ul>
             My emotional response to this was "It must be my code not working, the problem must be with me", "Who am I to think that the problem is external, not internal". My feeling of inadequacy came from thinking that I did not get the expected result for reasons other than myself. Then directly after that, I felt bad for feeling bad about something so silly.
          </p>
          <p>
             It took me a while to ask on Slack whether these were actual problems, and as a result I was blocked for longer than I should have.
          </p>
          <h4>How did you find the Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond technique?</h4>
          <p>
            I understand the concept of Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond.
            When you get triggered, I find it very useful to stop, breathe and notice. However, 
            <ul>
              <li>I find that it is often not possible for me to reflect at the time of trigger, either because I don't have the opportunity (e.g. I'm busy working on something with someone), or I have the opportunity but I'm not willing (I'm busy with something and reflecting now would distract me from my original task). Reflection is then mostly retrospective and the response at the time of the trigger is often to leave the emotion be, let go and find comfort in knowing that you can reflect on it later.</li>
              <li>I find that some emotional responses can take a really long while to understand. The process of reflection, understanding your emotional responses, in some cases, is really not straightforward.</li>
            </ul>
